Hello!

I used a combination of HTML/CSS and JavaScript/JQuery for my portfolio.

On my home page I have a nav bar with 4 links (Home, About Me, Resume, and Projects. Bringing your mouse over these links you will notice they fade out and once the mouse is moved they fade back to their origional color. Clicking will lead you to a new html page.

Center of the home page there is an "About Me" button. This also is a link but formatted into a button, when clicked will take you to the "About Me" page. This button shows a color change while hovering over the button and another color change when clicking the button to activate.

Below the "About Me" button, I have 3 links (GitHub, LinkedIn and a Contact Link). When bringing your mouse over these links you will notice they fade out and once the mouse is moved they fade back to their original color. The contact link when clicked, a modal popup containing my contact information will appear. There is a close button placed inside to close out and head back to the home page.

Clicking the links in the nav bar will take you to a new html page to read more: About Me, Resume and Projects.

When on the Project page, there are 4 buttons.  When bringing your mouse over theses buttons you will again notice the color change and another color change when clicking the button to active. When clicking the buttons, a script will show up and upon clicking again the script will disappear. As I do not have projects to show at the moment i will have a script in place.

Clicking the Home link will take you back to the home page.

Aside of my three JQuery interactrion used (button, mouseover/mouseout and a modal popup) I would of like to have had more time to add a carousel or play with the scroll interaction. Along with messing around with CSS more.
